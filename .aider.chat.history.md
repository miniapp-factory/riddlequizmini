#### Code the following app  
#### ```  
#### Solve short riddles.  
####   
#### ```  
####   
#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you need to make are in two files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create this file to generate the app logo image.  

Please add these two files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized puzzle piece forming a question mark, set against a gradient background that fades from deep blue at the top to vibrant purple at the bottom. The puzzle piece is rendered in a bright, contrasting color (e.g., electric yellow) with subtle shading to give it depth. Light rays emanate from the center of the puzzle piece, creating a subtle glow that highlights the question mark shape. The overall composition conveys the idea of solving riddles and puzzles, with a clean, modern aesthetic suitable for a mobile app logo.
